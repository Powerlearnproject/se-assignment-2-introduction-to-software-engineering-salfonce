Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Software Engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing and maintaining software application.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing and maintaining software application. Whereas software engineering focuses on all aspects of a software, traditional programming tends to focus on specific aspects such as writing codes, testing and updating of code.
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Software Development Life Cycle(SDLC) is a model used to show the processes taken to produce high quality software that meet users expectation. SDLC typically involves the following phases; Planning and requirement analysis, Designing, Development, Testing , Deployment and Maintenance

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Planning and requirement analysis - The onset of the project which combines the requirement analysis of inputs from the stakeholders of the system who will be the targeted end user. Tasks undertaken in this face include; defining the project scope, setting of the objectives and goals and resource planning

Designing - In this phase, the system architecture, database design, user interface design, and other technical specifications are created. The design phase focuses on translating requirements into a blueprint for the software solution.

Development -  This involves converting the design into actual code using programming languages, frameworks, and tools. The coding phase also includes unit testing to ensure that individual components of the software work as expected.

Testing -  involves systematically validating the software to ensure that it meets the specified requirements and functions correctly. This includes various types of testing such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing. The goal is to identify and fix defects or bugs before the software is deployed.

Deployment and Maintenance - Deploying of the software to the production environment after testing and approval. This involves installing the software, configuring it for use, and ensuring that it integrates smoothly with existing systems and processes. 

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
The Agile model is an iterative and incremental approach to software development that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. Mainly characterized by the delivering of deliverable in iterations known as sprints.
The waterfall Model is a linear and sequential approach to software development where progress flows downwards through distinct phases. Waterfall model has a rigid structure as each phase is dependent on the completion of the previous phase.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
The Agile model is iterative and incremental whereas the waterfall Model is a linear and sequential. In agile work is divide up in sprints which take relatively shorter time to come up with a deliverable while subsequent phases in waterfall are dependet on completion of preceding phases. Agile is ideal for short term projects requiring faster prototyping while waterfall is ideal ffor long term projects with well defined and stable requirements

Requirements Engineering:
Requirements engineering is the process of eliciting, documenting, analyzing, and managing requirements throughout the software development lifecycle 

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:
Requirements engineering is the process of eliciting, documenting, analyzing, and managing requirements throughout the software development lifecycle. Process involved include;
Elicitation: Involves gathering requirements from stakeholders through various techniques such as interviews, surveys, workshops, and observation.

Analysis: Once requirements are gathered, they are analyzed for feasibility, completeness, consistency, and relevance. Conflicting requirements are resolved, and ambiguities are clarified.

Specification: Requirements are documented in a clear and concise manner using appropriate documentation formats such as use cases, user stories, requirements documents, or prototypes.

Validation: Validating requirements involves ensuring that they accurately represent the needs of stakeholders and that they can be implemented within the constraints of the project. Techniques such as reviews, walkthroughs, and prototyping are used to validate requirements.

Management: Requirements are managed throughout the software development lifecycle to ensure traceability, version control, and alignment with project goals. Changes to requirements are carefully evaluated and controlled to minimize scope creep and project risks.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:
Modularity in software design refers to the practice of breaking down a system into smaller, self-contained units or modules, each responsible for a specific aspect of the system's functionality. 

Modularity enhances maintainability by localizing changes to specific modules, making it easier to understand and modify individual components without impacting the rest of the system. This reduces the risk of introducing unintended side effects or breaking existing functionality.

Modular systems are easier to scale, as new functionality can be added by introducing new modules or modifying existing ones without affecting the entire system. This allows for more flexible and incremental development.

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Unit testing is a software testing technique where individual units or components of a software application are tested in isolation to ensure that they function correctly

Integration testing is a software testing technique where individual units or modules of a software application are combined and tested as a group to ensure that they work together

System testing is a software testing technique that evaluates the complete, integrated system to ensure that it meets specified requirements and performs as expected in its intended environment

Acceptance testing is a software testing technique used to determine whether a software system meets the acceptance criteria and satisfies the requirements specified by stakeholders.

Version Control Systems:
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version control systems are tools and practices used to manage changes to source code or other collections of information.Enables teams to track modifications, collaborate effectively, and maintain a history of changes. Types of Version Control Systems include; Centralized Version Control Systems where there is a single repository and Distributed Version Control Systems where each user has a complete copy of the repository. Git is an example of popular version control system. It is an open source distributed version control system

Software Project Management:
Software project management is the process of planning, organizing, leading, and controlling software projects ensuring that software development projects are completed on time, within budget, and meet the desired quality standards.

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
A software project manager plays a crucial role in the successful planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.Key responsibilities include;
Project Planning and Management - Work with stakeholders to define project goals, deliverables, and timelines

Team Leadership and Development - Assemble and manage a skilled team of developers, testers, and other relevant roles.

Technical Oversight - Ensure the software architecture meets the projectâ€™s requirements and is scalable and maintainable.

Challenges faced in managing software projects include; 
Scope Creep: The tendency for project requirements to expand over time, which can lead to delays and budget overruns.

Integration Issues: Ensuring that different components of the software integrate smoothly can be challenging, especially when dealing with legacy systems or third-party software.

Skill Gaps: Differences in skill levels among team members can affect productivity and code quality.
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software maintenance involves the modification and updating of software applications after their initial deployment to ensure optimum and efficient operation.

Types of maintenance activities; 
Corrective Maintenance - Bug fixing and error correction

Adaptive Maintenance - Environment(Technological) changes, regulatory updates

Perfective Maintenance: Performance Improvements, Usability Enhancements

Preventive Maintenance: Refactoring. 

Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle
The primary goal of software maintenance is to ensure that software continues to operate correctly and efficiently, meets evolving user needs, and remains secure against emerging threats
